QRjammer
========

QR code jammer for sharing from desktop to mobile device, or device to device ... basically so you don't have to type in the url on your phone...


Default behavior:
- adds a button that generates a QR code for the window.location.href (whatever's in the address bar)
- clicking the button shows the QR for scanners to jump to the URL on your device


Basic Usage:
- include the QRjammer.js (assumes you have jQuery included first)
- next :
  <script type="text/javascript">
    QRjammer();
  </script>
- enjoy.
